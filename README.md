Practice with scripting in Photoshop and Illustrator.
Personally I am trying to figure out why scripting in Photoshop and Illustrator exists, which I am now realizing is
helpful because it externally automates things.
Also trying to figure out how to make my own experience using these Adobe applications easier.
